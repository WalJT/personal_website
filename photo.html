        <p>This is a photo I took shortly after bought my camera, more or less trying it out for the first time.
            I didn't quite know what I was doing yet, so I had the aperture wide open and shutter speed <b><i>WAY</i></b>
            higher than nececary, but my "mistakes" certainly gave it character.</p>
